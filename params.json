{"tagline":"Browser detection library for node.js, built on top of express","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"# express-device [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rguerreiro/express-device.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rguerreiro/express-device)\r\n\r\n## why express-device?\r\n\r\nI'm really into node.js and lately I've been playing a lot with it. One of the steps I wanted to take in my learning path was to build a node.js module and published it to npm. \r\n\r\nThen I had an idea: why not develop a server side library to mimic the behaviour that Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive) has in order to identify where a browser is running on a desktop, tablet or phone. This is great for a [responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design), but on the server side.\r\n\r\n## how it came to be?\r\n\r\nFirst I started to search how I could parse the user-agent string and how to differentiate tablets from smartphones. I found a couple good references, such as:\r\n- http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php\r\n- http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/\r\n- http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html\r\n- http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.pt/2011/03/mo-better-to-also-detect-mobile-user.html\r\n- http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/webmaster/toolbox/article.php/3888106/How-Can-I-Detect-the-iPhone--iPads-User-Agent.htm\r\n- http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2011/08/29/introducing-the-ie9-on-windows-phone-mango-user-agent-string.aspx\r\n\r\nBut then I came across with Brett Jankord's [blog](http://www.brettjankord.com). He developed [Categorizr](http://www.brettjankord.com/2012/01/16/categorizr-a-modern-device-detection-script/) which is what I was trying to do for node.js but for PHP. He has the code hosted at [Github](https://github.com/bjankord/Categorizr). So, express-device parsing methods (to extract device type) are based on Categorizr. Also I've used all of his [user-agent strings compilation](http://brettjankord.com/categorizr/categorizr-results.php) to build my unit tests.\r\n\r\n## how to use it?\r\n\r\nTo install it you only need to do:\r\n \r\n    $ npm install express-device\r\n    \r\nCase you're using [express](http://expressjs.com/) 2.x.x you should install version 0.1.2:\r\n \r\n    $ npm install express-device@0.1.2\r\n\r\nexpress-device is built on top of [express](http://expressjs.com/) framework. Here's an example on how to configure express to use it:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\napp.configure(function(){\r\n    app.set('view engine', 'ejs');\r\n    app.set('view options', { layout: false });\r\n    app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\r\n    \r\n    app.use(express.bodyParser());\r\n    app.use(device.capture());\r\n});\r\n```\r\nBy doing this you're enabling the **request** object to have a property called **device**, which have the following properties:\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Field Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Possible Values</strong></td></tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>type</td>\r\n        <td>string</td>\r\n        <td>It gets the device type for the current request</td>\r\n        <td>desktop, tv, tablet ot phone</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nexpress-device can also add some variables to the response [locals property](http://expressjs.com/api.html#res.locals\\(\\)) that will help you to build a responsive design:\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>is_desktop</td>\r\n        <td>It returns true in case the device type is \"desktop\"; false otherwise</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>is_phone</td>\r\n        <td>It returns true in case the device type is \"phone\"; false otherwise</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>is_tablet</td>\r\n        <td>It returns true in case the device type is \"tablet\"; false otherwise</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>is_mobile</td>\r\n        <td>It returns true in case the device type is \"phone\" or \"tablet\"; false otherwise</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>is_tv</td>\r\n        <td>It returns true in case the device type is \"tv\"; false otherwise</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>device_type</td>\r\n        <td>It returns the device type string parsed from the request</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nIn order to enable this methods you have to call **app.enableDeviceHelpers()**, just before **app.use(app.router)**.\r\n\r\nHere's an example on how to use them (using [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) view engine):\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n    <title><%= title %></title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <h1>Hello World!</h1>\r\n    <% if (is_desktop) { %>\r\n    <p>You're using a desktop</p>\r\n    <% } %>\r\n    <% if (is_phone) { %>\r\n    <p>You're using a phone</p>\r\n    <% } %>\r\n    <% if (is_tablet) { %>\r\n    <p>You're using a tablet</p>\r\n    <% } %>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check a full working example [here](https://github.com/rguerreiro/express-device/tree/master/example).\r\n\r\nIn version 0.3.0 a cool feature was added: the ability to route to a specific view\\layout based on the device type. Consider the infrastruture below:\r\n\r\n    .\r\n    |-- views\r\n        |-- phone\r\n        |    |-- layout.ejs\r\n        |    `-- index.ejs\r\n        |-- layout.ejs\r\n        `-- index.ejs\r\n\r\nAnd this code:\r\n```javascript\r\napp.configure(function(){\r\n    app.set('view engine', 'ejs');\r\n    app.set('view options', { layout: true });\r\n    app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\r\n    \r\n    app.use(express.bodyParser());\r\n    app.use(device.capture());\r\n\r\n    app.enableViewRouting();\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\r\n    res.render('index.ejs');\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the request comes from a *phone* device then the response will render views/phone/index.ejs view with views/phone/layout.ejs as layout. If it comes from another type of device then it will render the default views/index.ejs with the default views/index.ejs. Simply add a folder below your views root with the device type code (phone, tablet, tv or desktop) for the device type overrides. Several combinations are supported. Please check the [tests](https://github.com/rguerreiro/express-device/blob/master/test/view_route_test.js) for more examples.\r\n\r\n## contributors\r\n\r\n- [rguerreiro](https://github.com/rguerreiro)\r\n- [aledbf](https://github.com/aledbf)\r\n\r\n## where to go from here?\r\n\r\nCurrently express-device is on version 0.3.0.
